# Smart-Autonomous-Air-Quality-and-Environmental-Monitoring-Bot
It is a small robot that is capable of analysing its new environment with the help of sensors and the 360 camera with night vision and human tracking. It is controlled remotely by human for emergency recue purposes. It is fitted with ESP32 for data live data feed and have tank threads to overcome obstacles. The live data have been tracked and converted into a interactive data visualisation dashboard using PowerBi software. The live feed camera sends the data through Wi-Fi which can me viewed in the website virtually.

 # Hardware for set-up:

- L298N motor driver
- Tank Base with Tracks
- 12V DC motors
- 12V lithium ion battery pack
- Arduino UNO
- FS-TC6V and FS-R6B(Transmitter and receiver)
- ESP32 CAM - Video live feed 
- ESP 32 - Brain of the hardware has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities

**_Sensors_:**

- BMP 180 - to measure pressure accurately

- DHTT - to measure the present temperature of the surrounding

- MQ 2- to measure the toxic atoms or gases in the atmosphere where the hardware is present

- MQ 135- to determine the level of CO2 gas in the place where the device is present

- OLED - for displaying the contents of the above sensor
